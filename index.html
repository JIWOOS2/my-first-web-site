  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p> This award represents the culmination of a quarter-century of work at W3C.
  <br>Web Fonts enable people to use fonts on demand over the web without requiring installation in the operating system.
  <br>W3C has experience in downloadable fonts through HTML, CSS2, and SVG. Downloadable fonts were not common on the web due to the lack of an interoperable font format.
  <br>The Web Fonts effort addresses that through the creation of an industry-supported, open font format for the web called “WOFF” (Web Open Font Format)
  <br>whose version 2, which became a standard in 2018, is deployed in all major web browsers and powers a vast majority of sites.
